\chapter*{Introduction}

When I sat down to write this book, I was overcome with emotion. I will be talking about none of that emotion.  Instead, this will be an homage to Hokusai's 36 views of Mount Fuji and the Bebbocraft Season 4 Server.

My goal was to highlight the landmark which all of our bases are built around. With Distant Horizons, the summit can be viewed from basically anywhere on the server. Because of this, the mountain is part of many of the vistas and has burned its way into my subconscious.  This short art book is an attempt to capture that mountain in its full glory.

I will be doing the rest of this book in a somewhat diagetic fashion, as if I was a documentarian taking a history of the mountain and its surroundings. Pictured here is the intrepid documentarian on the job. This is also technically the 29th view of Mount Bebbo and the first in the book other than the cover but eh, I'm not counting it. 

A note about the book's presentation. I haven't used LaTeX in a while and I didnt have access to Illustrator or Indesign. Thus there is some weirdness in formatting. Chapters are frontloaded with text so feel free to skip through to the pictures.\columnbreak
